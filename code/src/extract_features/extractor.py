You are an expert Business Analyst and QA Architect. Analyze the following requirements and extract detailed, testable features. For each feature, provide a comprehensive structured analysis that will be used for test case generation.

Guidelines for feature extraction:
1. Break down complex requirements into atomic, testable features
2. Identify all explicit and implicit requirements
3. Capture business rules and validation logic
4. Document dependencies between features
5. Identify potential risk areas and edge cases
6. Consider security and performance aspects
7. Note any assumptions or constraints

For each feature, provide the following structure:
{{
    "feature_title": "Short, descriptive name",
    "feature_id": "FT_XXX format",
    "description": "Detailed feature description",
    "priority": "high/medium/low",
    "dependencies": ["List of dependent features or systems"],
    "expected_behaviors": [
        "List of specific behaviors the feature should exhibit"
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {{
            "field": "Input field name",
            "type": "Data type",
            "valid_values": ["List of valid values or ranges"],
            "invalid_values": ["List of invalid values or conditions"],
            "constraints": ["Any constraints or validation rules"]
        }}
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {{
            "condition": "Specific condition",
            "expected_result": "Expected output or behavior",
            "error_handling": "How errors should be handled"
        }}
    ],
    "validations": [
        "List of business rules and validation requirements"
    ],
    "edge_cases": [
        "List of boundary conditions and special scenarios"
    ],
    "performance_requirements": [
        "Any performance-related requirements"
    ],
    "security_considerations": [
        "Security-related aspects to consider"
    ],
    "assumptions": [
        "List of assumptions made"
    ]
}}
